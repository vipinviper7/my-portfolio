          <p>Zoho Sprints had no way to talk to its users from inside the product. Product updates, subscription reminders, community posts, promotions — none of it reached users in-app.</p>
          <p>My manager handed me a requirements doc and a clear ask: <strong>design an updates system that handles all of this without overwhelming people.</strong></p>

        </div>
        <div class="cs-body">
          <p>The challenge wasn't "design a notification panel." It was fitting very different types of content into one space.</p>
          <p>Product announcements users need to know about. Subscription reminders that require action. Community updates that are nice-to-have. Promotions most people ignore. <strong>All competing for the same screen space, all arriving at different frequencies.</strong></p>
          <p>Show too much, users ignore everything. Show too little, they miss what matters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="cs-body">
          <p>~10 iterations over two weeks. Here's how my thinking shifted:</p>
          <p><strong>Early on</strong> — I jumped into designing structured cards with clear hierarchy. Looked polished, but feedback was it's overdesigned. Too heavy for what this needed to be.</p>
          <p><strong>The key shift</strong> — My manager pushed toward simplicity, and it was the right call. These needed to behave like notifications — scannable, lightweight — but carry more information than a typical notification. That tension drove the rest of the process.</p>
          <p><strong>Where I drifted</strong> — A few iterations went off-script from Sprints' existing design language. Looked good in isolation, felt wrong in the product. Pulling back to align with what existed actually made decisions easier.</p>
          <p><strong>What landed</strong> — Notification-style items with clear titles and enough room for context underneath. Simple enough to scan, detailed enough to be useful.</p>

          <p>A single update feed inside the product. One place for everything.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>One stream, no tabs. Everything sorted by time.</li>
            <li>Visual distinction by update type — users can tell at a glance what needs attention.</li>
            <li>Scannable by default, expandable for detail.</li>
            <li>Action-driven updates (like subscription reminders) visually separated from passive ones.</li>

          <p>The core design shipped intact. The icons were redrawn during development to better match Sprints' existing icon style — flagged during review.</p>

      <!-- What I Took Away -->
      <section class="cs-section">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">What I Took Away</h2>
        <div class="cs-body">
          <p><strong>Simpler was harder.</strong> My instinct was to design something rich. Simplifying felt like a step backward — but it made the design better.</p>
          <p><strong>Stay inside the design language.</strong> The iterations where I went off-script looked interesting but felt disconnected. The best version felt like it had always been there.</p>
          <p><strong>Fast iteration beats perfect first drafts.</strong> Ten iterations in two weeks. None of them were precious. That helped.</p>
