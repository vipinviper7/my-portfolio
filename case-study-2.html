        <h2 class="cs-section-title">The Brief</h2>
        <div class="cs-body">
          <p>Zoho Sprints was launching its 2.0 version, and multiple screens across the product were being redesigned. The settings screen was one of them.</p>
          <p>My job was to <strong>redesign the existing settings page — improve how it looked and felt, without changing any functionality.</strong></p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- What Was Wrong -->
      <section class="cs-section">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">What Was Wrong</h2>
        <div class="cs-image-block cs-image-block--blue">
          <img src="assets/images/cs2-existing.png" alt="Old UI of Settings screen" onerror="this.style.display='none'">
        </div>
        <div class="cs-body">
          <p>The old settings page didn't look like a settings page. It was functional — everything worked — but the presentation didn't match the importance of what was there.</p>
          <p>The profile section was one of the most-used parts, but it wasn't treated that way visually. There was no clear grouping, no real hierarchy. <strong>Everything sat at the same visual weight, so nothing stood out.</strong> You had to read every label to find what you needed.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Constraints -->
      <section class="cs-section">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Constraints</h2>
        <div class="cs-body">
          <p>This was a visual redesign, not a re-architecture. All existing settings and behaviors stayed the same. The layout needed to align with the rest of the 2.0 update — so it had to feel like it belonged in the new version, not like a leftover from the old one.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- How It Evolved -->
      <section class="cs-section">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">How It Evolved</h2>
        <div class="cs-image-block cs-image-block--blue">
          <img src="assets/images/cs2-iterations-1.png" alt="Early iterations" onerror="this.style.display='none'">
        </div>
        <div class="cs-image-block cs-image-block--blue">
          <img src="assets/images/cs2-iterations-2.png" alt="Later iterations" onerror="this.style.display='none'">
        </div>
        <div class="cs-body">
          <p>I worked through several iterations, refining with feedback from my manager along the way.</p>
          <p><strong>The first thing I tackled</strong> was the profile section — giving it the visual weight it deserved. It was the most important area on the page but was being treated the same as everything else.</p>
          <p><strong>From there</strong>, it was about grouping and hierarchy. Related settings needed to sit together. Sections needed clear separation. The page needed to be scannable — you should be able to find what you're looking for without reading everything.</p>
          <p><strong>Consistency</strong> was the other thread throughout. The redesign had to match patterns used elsewhere in the 2.0 update. Anything that felt out of place got pulled back in line.</p>
        </div>

      <!-- Final Design -->

          <ul>
            <li>Profile section given proper visual prominence</li>
            <li>Clear section grouping with defined hierarchy</li>
            <li>Scannable layout — find what you need without reading every label</li>
            <li>Scalable structure for future settings additions</li>
            <li>Consistent with the rest of Sprints 2.0</li>

        </div>
        <div class="cs-body">
          <p>The redesigned settings screen shipped with the 2.0 launch. It brought a frequently-used screen up to the same standard as the rest of the product.</p>

      <!-- What I Took Away -->
      <section class="cs-section">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">What I Took Away</h2>
        <div class="cs-body">
          <p><strong>Not every project needs to be complex to matter.</strong> This was a straightforward visual redesign. No user research, no massive pivots. But settings pages are one of those screens people use constantly — getting it right has a quiet, compounding impact.</p>
          <p><strong>Hierarchy is the whole game.</strong> The old page had the same content as the new one. The difference was just how it was organized and weighted. That alone changed how it felt to use.</p>
