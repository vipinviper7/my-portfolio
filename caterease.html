        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Where It Started</h2>
        <div class="cs-body">
          <p>I was trying to book a caterer for my son's birthday. It was a mess &mdash; phone calls, WhatsApp messages, no way to compare prices, no transparency on what I was actually paying for.</p>
          <p>That frustration became the project. When I had to pick a problem space for my 10K Designers cohort, I already knew what I wanted to fix.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- The Problem -->
      <section class="cs-section">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">The Problem</h2>
        <div class="cs-body">
          <p>Booking a caterer in India runs entirely on phone calls, WhatsApp, and word-of-mouth. There's no way to compare options side-by-side, no upfront pricing, no written agreements.</p>
          <p>What that actually looks like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You call 3&ndash;5 caterers and get different prices from each &mdash; sometimes different prices from the same caterer</li>
            <li>Delivery, setup, and staff costs show up after you've already committed</li>
            <li>Menu items get changed without notice because nothing is in writing</li>
            <li>On event day, you have zero visibility on whether your food is on track</li>
            <li>If the experience is bad, there's nowhere to report it</li>
          </ul>

      <!-- Research -->
      <section class="cs-section">
        <h2 class="cs-section-title">Research</h2>
        <div class="cs-body">
          <p>I started with what I knew &mdash; my own experience booking caterers &mdash; and expanded from there. I studied people in my circle who regularly book catering: a budget-conscious parent planning family functions, a corporate admin handling office events, a professional who pays premium and expects quality.</p>
          <p>I also dug into the market: existing platforms, competitor gaps, online reviews, community complaints, and pricing patterns across Chennai.</p>
          <p>Three patterns kept showing up across every segment:</p>
          <p><strong>Trust is the biggest barrier.</strong> People want verified caterers, real photos, FSSAI certification, and reviews from actual customers &mdash; not curated testimonials.</p>
          <p><strong>Pricing is a black box.</strong> The same caterer quotes different prices to different people. Hidden charges for delivery, setup, and staff are the norm, not the exception.</p>
          <p><strong>There's no accountability.</strong> Once you pay the advance, you have no leverage. No tracking, no written agreement, no recourse if quality drops.</p>

          <p>Using the 5 Whys framework on each persona's top pain point, six root causes surfaced:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>No digital agreement system &mdash; everything is verbal</li>
            <li>No feedback loop &mdash; bad experiences go unreported</li>
            <li>No real-time order or delivery tracking</li>
            <li>No locked order summary &mdash; menu items change after booking</li>
            <li>No transparent cost breakdown &mdash; hidden charges everywhere</li>
            <li>No payment tracking &mdash; unclear advance/balance schedule</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Every root cause pointed to the same gap: there's no system. The entire catering industry runs on trust and phone calls. The app needed to be that system.</p>

          <p>After the research and design, I wanted to see if this could actually work as a product &mdash; not just as a Figma file. I used Claude Code to vibe-code a fully functional React Native app.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>26 screens, 12 demo caterers, 114 menu items</li>
            <li>Built with React Native (Expo), Supabase backend, NativeWind</li>
            <li>Fully navigable demo &mdash; browse caterers, build orders, track bookings</li>

          <p>The goal wasn't production-ready code. It was proving that the research held up when you could actually tap through the experience.</p>

        <div class="cs-body">
          <p><strong>Start with a problem you've felt.</strong> The best part of my research came from already understanding the frustration firsthand. It made every insight sharper because I wasn't discovering the problem &mdash; I was confirming and expanding what I already knew.</p>
          <p><strong>Research is the real design work.</strong> The screens came together fast because the decisions were already made. Every layout choice traced back to a finding. That's what I want my design process to look like going forward.</p>
          <p><strong>Building it changed how I think about design.</strong> Vibe-coding the app forced me to confront things Figma doesn't &mdash; edge cases, empty states, real data. It made the design better retroactively.</p>
