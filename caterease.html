          <p>My son's birthday was coming up. I needed a caterer. What followed was three days of phone calls, WhatsApp messages, and second-guessing &mdash; with no way to compare prices, no written menu, and no clue what the final bill would look like.</p>

        <h2 class="cs-section-title">What I Learned</h2>
        <div class="cs-body">
          <p><strong>Start with a problem you've felt.</strong> My best research insights came from already understanding the frustration firsthand. I wasn't discovering the problem &mdash; I was confirming and expanding what I already knew.</p>
          <p><strong>Research is the real design work.</strong> The screens came together fast because the decisions were already made. Every layout choice traced back to a finding.</p>
          <p><strong>Building it changed how I think about design.</strong> Coding the app forced me to confront things Figma doesn't &mdash; edge cases, empty states, real data. It made the design better retroactively.</p>
